Automatic doors used in shopping malls and hotels use PLC for automation systems. If the sensor detects an object passing through the door, it will send signals to the system and automatically open and then close the door after 10 seconds. A sensory switch such as an infrared human body sensor can be used for this project. The door can be operated in AUTO mode or MANUAL mode. For MANUAL mode, the maintenance operator can open and close the door using an HMI interface. As well, on the HMI interface, the maintenance operator can reset the alarm if an alarm occurs after he assures that the automatic door is proper to work. On the HMI interface, it is presented the Alarm led, Open door led, and a text who displays if the door is closed or open.
